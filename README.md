# Cat-tastrophe

Cat-tastrophe is a 2D turn-based sidescrolling artillery shooter based off of classic games like Gorillaz, Tanx, and Worms Armageddon. This game allows user to play on a selection of premade maps shooting at each other until only one cat remains. Each player can adjust the angle of their shot, the power of their shot, and move left and right on a fully destructible terrain. This game features background music, and remains under construction as new features are being added. Currently in progress is compatibility for cross-computer multiplayer.
